# Mongoose-express with client app (React)

A simple express server with mongoose (ODM) with typescript and a client app (Vite/React) to manage the blog posts and other data.
Demo https://blog.floatrx.net/

> [!NOTE]
> The main goal is to demonstrate how MongoDB works with Express server in Node.js, using the Mongoose ODM. 
> I created a simple client-side part for demonstration purposes. 
> For a search engine-friendly blog, it's best to go with Next.js.
